# Bayesian-Inference


Hello, everyone.



This is my first time using github, a great move.
I have beening training myself to be a data scientist. I get a lot of help from github and youtube, and I also want to contribute something.
To see equation on this site, one can download Google Chrome: (GitHub with MathJax)< >
or  Tex All the Things

Enjoy.
